# test file for triphic points definition
# smarts defined in triphic_test.smt
# each line defines a type of point of interest. The first string (donor,
# acceptor, posch etc) is the name of the type and the other strings are the
# names of the SMARTS definitions to define that type.  In the examples below,
# rings will thus be comprised the centroid of either 5- or 6-membered rings
# but any other ring size will be ignored. In the SMARTS file, ring5 is defined
# as *1****1 and ring 6 as *1*****1.
